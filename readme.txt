== Why do I want video in my blog? ==

For example you run a blog about cooking. You watched a TV show about cooking and thought: “Hey! I can record video recipes as well!”. You’ve recorded how you cooked a lobster, now you google for video plugin for Wordpress.  Fortunately,  you  found Bubblecast video plugin, it took you 2 minutes to register, install it and post the video.  You briefly looked through plugin’s features and was struck by another idea: “Hey! My readers can post their video recipes to comment mine. We can create a library of video recipes. I can even make money on that if I gather enough video clips”.

By this example I want to make emphasis on publishing capabilities of Bubblecast, this is what brings the power of User Generated Content to your blog.

Although it sounds like blogging for commercial purpose you can also imagine that you post your home video to your personal blog and your friends comment  it with their own video clips.
